### Description

While I was looking for examples of portfolios for inspiration for my own, I stumbled across someone who had made theirs with a framework called Gatsby - a tool I hadn't heard of yet. A quick google search told me it was simply a way to deliver code in a quicker way than I had been doing thus far, a concept I'm always a fan of as an impatient internet user myself, so I decided to try it out.

I started with the blog tutorial they have on their website and then fleshed it out a bit with a tag system and some custom CSS. The idea for the blog theme itself took a couple of days to come to me - I'm not a natural blogger - but after trying to find an old recipe of mine, I realized I could actually make my life easier than relying on the scraps of paper lying around my house that I used to record my favorite foods. The idea behind the name is derived from my shocking and concerning lack of a memory regarding anything, really.

I found the framework nice to work with, though there were a couple of things that weren't as intuitive as they could be - but that's true of all code, really. I'm toying with the idea of making a portfolio with Gatsby just to continue to play around with the framework or I might continue work on the ecommerce website I started but stopped working on due to time constraints - unfortunately, backend stuff does not come naturally to me.

### Credit

[Various tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/) and [how to guides](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-tags-and-categories-to-blog-posts/) from Gatsby's website. Much of the logic for the dynamic components and pages is from the starter blog found [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/tutorial-example). The how to guide I followed to add tags I had to refactor to use MDX that was used in the started blog as they started using Remark in the how to guide but the basic logic is from there. If I ever have enough entries to warrant it, I will add pagination from their [guide on that](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-pagination/).
