### Description

While I was looking for examples of portfolios for inspiration for my own, I stumbled across someone who had made theirs with a framework called Gatsby and I had been interested in playing around with different frameworks so I just chose this one to play around with first.

The idea for the blog theme itself took a couple of days to come to me - I'm not a natural blogger - but after trying to find an old recipe of mine, I realized I could actually make my life easier than relying on the scraps of paper lying around my house that I used to record my favorite recipes. The idea behind the name is derived from my shocking and concerning lack of a memory regarding, well, anything, really.

### Roadmap

- ~~Mobile friendly~~
- Search bar (probably not, it's not that complicated of a site)
- Related posts routed - unsure of this, I tend to route to other specific posts in the recipes/descriptions themselves
- Pagination, possibly, just for funsies

### Usage

You know the drill. VSCode, git clone, have fun.

Otherwise, you can see the Gatsby site [here](https://main--did-i-leave-the-stove-on.netlify.app/).
