Anyone who knows me, knows I f\*\*\*ing love rice. I especially love rice with a protein of some sort and a sauce that ties both food items together - Chicken Dijon and Rice Pilaf, Orange Chicken and Fried Rice, the list goes on. My friend turned me on to HelloFresh a couple of years ago, which I tried for a few weeks to broaden my horizons when it comes to food and - spoiler alert: I still hate tomatoes - I discovered a couple of recipes that I've come to love and keep in rotation.

This is the Lone Star Chicken Rice Bowl from HelloFresh that I've tweaked to my own specifications.

>
> 1. Make the rice.
> 2. Chop up the peppers and chicken (peppers very small, chicken cubed to the size of your desire).
> 3. Heat pan with drizzle of oil on medium-high heat. Add peppers and let cook until softened.
> 4. Add a little more oil and chicken, flip after a couple of minutes.
> 5. In a mixing cup, mix a cup of water and the tex-mex paste and the tomato paste until dissolved, pour over chicken.
> 6. Simmer the chicken mix for ~10-15 minutes.
> 7. Once rice is cooked, add lime juice and cilantro (not too much of either!!) and a sprinkle of salt.
> 8. Serve chicken on a heaping bed of rice. Top with homemade jalapeno cream sauce.
> 9. Make it look pretty for the snapchat and then mix together to eat.
