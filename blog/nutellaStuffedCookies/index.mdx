I don't know about you guys, but I've officially given up on gift giving for my family. It's not that I'm bad at it - I'm actually very good at it, if I do say so myself, but after 28 years of existing (25ish of those giving gifts at Christmas and birthdays), I've simply run out of ideas. Last Christmas was my breaking point - I literally couldn't think of a single thing to give anyone - not even my sister, who was always an easy one with her obsession with Harry Potter (a franchise I, unfortunately, [can't bring myself](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/gop-senator-quotes-j-k-rowling-while-blocking-vote-lgbtq-n1231569) to [support anymore](https://glaad.org/gap/jk-rowling/), for [obvious](https://one-colorado.org/new/how-the-nyt-and-jk-rowling-influence-anti-trans-policies/) [reasons](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2020/07/j-k-rowling-likes-tweet-supported-conversion-therapy/)).

So I decided to officially give up and just bake everyone cookies - but I did throw in a voucher for me to bake a dozen cookies of their selection whenever they want, so, y'know, I'm not a total Scrooge.

- Oven Temp: 375F
- Cooking Time: 12-13 minutes
- Makes: 20 large cookies

<br />

1. Brown the butter (key step, makes the whole cookie have a wonderfully rich nutty taste)
2. Place small dollops of Nutella on a cookie sheet and place in freeze until completely hardened
3. Add sugars into browned butter (once cooled)
4. Stir in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla extract.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
6. Slowly add flour mixture to butter mixture
7. Add finely chopped chocolate (stir well but NOT WITH HANDS, you will melt the chocolate very easily)
8. Chill dough for 20 minutes
9. Once Nutella is frozen enough and dough is cold enough, scoop 1 1/2 tbsp of dough and press frozen Nutella into the center and form the dough around the Nutella
10. Roll into ball (do not handle too much, will melt chocolate) and place on parchment paper lined sheet then freeze for 15 minutes
11. Place cookies 2 inches apart on sheet and bake for 12-13 minutes (check after 10 bc your oven sucks)
12. Sprinkle immediately with salt
