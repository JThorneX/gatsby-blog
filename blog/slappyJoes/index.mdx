There's few things as good as some good ol' fashioned homemade SLAPPY JOES. Yes, you are legally required to refer to these as Slappy Joes - even if you don't eat them in...joe form, like me. If you call them slopping joes, you will be put into the timeout corner with my father and will be forced to wear the cone of shame.

This is my maternal grandmother's recipe heavily modified, the main legacy that is showcased here is the liquid smoke. I never met her, but she apparently was a fan of liquid smoke so you know she had good taste.

- Cooking Time: ~40 minutes
- Makes: A heaping pile of Slappy Joes

<br />

1. In a bowl, mix the meat together. This helps the meat be more consistent, flavor wise.
2. Heat pan up, keep flame on medium. Slap the meat down in the pan and spread it around so it's flatish.
3. Sizzle and pop, let it cook a bit, and then start to flip it around. You want it to mostly cook through, while breaking it up so it doesn't clump together.
4. Add tomato sauce, water, liquid smoke, and spices. Mix it all up.
5. Lower flame to low, cover, and let simmer for ~30 minutes.
6. Taste and add spices to your preference and mix.
7. Serve in a bowl, or in a bun, (bowl is better) and serve with [Babi Ranch](https://gatsbyblogmain59051.gatsbyjs.io/blog/babi-ranch-dressing/) and a smattering of...Babi cheese on top. Which I'm not realizing is probably confusing if you don't know what that is. It's shredded mexican style cheese - the orange and white stuff. Don't ask why everything is named after me, okay?
