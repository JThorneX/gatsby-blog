I have tried a lot of brownie recipes over the year, and they're all largely the same, y'know? So, I searched for brownie recipe and chose the first one and this is the one going on here and I'm tagging it "to try" just so I know I should probably make it at some point to see if it's any good but, I mean, c'mon, they're brownies. Who messes up brownies?

Then I started second guessing myself and the recipe so I checked it against a second totally random recipe, but this person _is_ a culinary scientist. I have no idea if that's true but I'm having fun reading her [analysis of brownies.](https://handletheheat.com/chewy-brownies/)

Additionally, I'm just gonna put [this](https://handletheheat.com/nutella-brownie/) here for me to NOT MAKE because I have very STRONG WILLPOWER and am not weak anytime NUTELLA IS INVOLVED.

- Oven Temp: 325F
- Cooking Time: 30-35 minutes
- Makes: 9 large or 16 small brownies

<br />

1. Preheat oven. Preprepare pan with parchment paper and cooking oil if you that bitch.
2. Mic the butter and sugar, make sure the butter is melted.
3. Whisk in the eggs, egg yolk (lmao), and vanilla.
4. Stir in the oil and cocoa powder.
5. Stir in the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt.
6. Stir in chocolate chips/whatever thing you're putting in. If you put nuts in your brownies, you're dead to me ‚ù§Ô∏èüòò.
7. Spread batter in the prepared pan you totally definitely prepared.
8. Oven, cook. Toothpick trick, done. Let cool before cutting.
