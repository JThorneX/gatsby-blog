Taco Bell is probably my favorite trash 'Mexican' food, it's great when you want Mexican food that doesn't really resemble Mexican food all that much, y'know? They have this Jalapeño cream sauce that I was obsessed with and would add to literally every item I get and after getting fed up of paying 30 cents for a small container whenever I got Taco Bell, I thought, "it can't be that hard to make, right?" which is RIGHT. It's not that hard at all. And this recipe is like 60% better than Taco Bell's and makes a bunch, so it's a win-win.

1. In a food processor, puree that shit up.
2. Add a touch of water, if you'd like more of a drizzling sauce consistency rather than a dipping sauce.
