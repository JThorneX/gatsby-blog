| 2-3 | Chicken Breasts | |
| 2-4 tbsp | Pesto | If you're like me, you'll do 4 tbsp, if you want to be healthier, you'll do 2 tbsp|

- Oven Temp: 350F
- Cooking Time: 20-25 minutes

1. **Either** pound the chicken flat or cut them into strips.
2. Mix the sawdust/parmesan with the panko breading.
3. Coat the chicken in pesto, and then the breading/parm mix.
4. Bake or air fry for 20-25 minutes at 375F. I'll be honest, I've yet to make this in the air fryer, I think you could do like 15 minutes at 400F and it would turn out crispier, which is the aim.
5. Serve with [ranch](https://gatsbyblogmain59051.gatsbyjs.io/blog/babi-ranch-dressing/) and a side of rice pilaf.
