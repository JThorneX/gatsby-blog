I don't drink often, alcohol gives me headaches/migraines more often than not, so I really only indulge when I can tell my head won't be in splitting pain in 2 hours. When I do drink, it's usually whisky or rum, all other alcohol tastes the same to me, and it's just not good.

My family and I were on vacation at the esteemed Broadmoor in Colorado Springs in 2018 during their centennial anniversary and they had a 'cocktails of the past' kind of class thing with samples of all the 'tails. One of those was called the Sazerac and I took a sip and went, "this is mine now," and it's been my drink of choice at cocktail bars since - outside of cocktail bars I really don't expect them to know what a Sazerac even is so I just order a Manhattan or Old Fashioned.

- Makes: 1 Glass of Sazerac

<br />

1. Chill a glass. No seriously, stop trying to make the rest, chill the glass. Once it is COLD, rinse it with absinthe. Usually, most recipes - which is to say all of them - will say to discard any excess, I do not do this. Ideally, you only put in literally a splash so that after coating the whole of the inside of the glass, there's only like ~1/2 tsp left - leave it in. Honestly, it tastes better. I don't even like absinthe, I don't like black licorice in general, but it really helps give the drink a slightly better spicy punch without detracting any taste from the bitters/whisky.
2. In your shaky shake cup, muddle a sugar cube or just add your simple syrup (I'm a simple syrup bitch, myself), water, and the bitters. Add the whisky. Narrate all of this and when you say whisky say it like, "hhhwhisky," for no one but yourself.
3. Fill the shakey shake cup with ice and shakey shake. Shake until your hands hurt from how cold the shakey shake cup is. Be annoyed with how many times I just made you read shakey shake. Personally, the word shake has lost all meaning to me at this point.
4. Strain into the COLD glass that is definitely COLD because you CHILLED IT RIGHT? RIGHT.
5. Okay, here's where we get fancy and think we could be a bartender (we totally couldn't). Take the orange peel, twist it, and glide it over the surface of the cup's rim, and then slam dunk that baby in the drink. Do it with a flick of your wrist for the flair and tell whoever's watching, "y'know, I could be a bartender".
6. Accept that you could not in a million years be a bartender.
