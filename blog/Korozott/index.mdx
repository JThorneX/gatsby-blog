This recipe is gonna be really, really good for some people and really, really just not great for others. Because I don't know the measurements. You just gotta follow your heart with a lot of this, good luck.

1. Room temperature ingredients is a must. Mix all together. Serve cold (not as good) or at room temp (better) on bread/cracker of your choice (sourdough is best).
