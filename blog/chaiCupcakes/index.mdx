Once again, a recipe I've never tried but I saw it and went, "Fuck." Like, c'mon, look at that picture. So, here we are. 

My inner basic white bitch screams for the chai flavor every fall so I am putting this here in my "to try" category to make in like, November.

- Oven Temp: 350F
- Cooking Time: 20-22 minutes
- Makes: 14-15 cup-a-cakes

<br />

1. Make the chai mix. It's not that complicated, I believe in you.
2. Steep the tea. Mic the milk and let that bitch steep for a long ass time. Hell, put it in the fridge overnight.
3. Oven to 350F, preprepare a muffin pan with cupcake liners, you will have leftovers, that is okay. Be awesome and make a itty bitty wittle baby cake, it'll be adorable.
4. Whisk flour, dry chai mix, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together.
5. STAND MIXER TIME. Hell yeah, power tools, we're baking tough. Beat sugar and butter together until smoof, like my brain.
6. Beat in egg whites on high.
7. Beat in sour cream and vanilla extract.
8. Contemplate how a cishet man would make a beat insert-your-misogynistic-target-of-choice joke here and thank all the deities that you are neither.
9. On low, mix in dry ingredients, DO NOT OVERMIX. Still on low, slowly pour in the chai milk. DO NOT OVERMIX for the love of god. 
10. Get high on the fumes of chai cake batter.
11. Pour into liners, fill 2/3. With the excess, make a itty bitty wittle baby cake while using that one voice, you know the one. Tell your dogs who have been staring at you this whole time not to judge you in that same voice.
12. BAKE. Toothpick trick around 18 minutes until done. 
> Time for frosting
13. With the stand mixer you literally _just_ cleaned - whatever it's fine - beat butter on medium until creamy.
14. Add powdered sugar a cup at a time, and heavy cream a tbsp at a time. You can always just dump everything in together at once, but that is messy and you will look like you got into an accident at a...cocaine factory. Okay, not the best metaphor but it will be bad! When it's all basically mixed, beat on high for like 2 minutes.
15. Okay, here you need to use your judgement, it's okay you can do it, I believe in you. If it needs thickening, add up to 1/2 cup more sugar, if it's too dummy thicc, add up to another tbsp of cream. 
16. Once you take the cupcakes out of the oven, let them cool obvi, and then frost them with a fancy ass piping tip. Remember: it's gotta look instagrammable for the snap - not for the instagram, we don't use that, it's just an adjective at this point. Literally, google it, google will tell you it's an adjective. 
17. Use the rest of the dry chai mix to top and make it look fancy af.
18. Cover and store leftovers but like, y'know, I've got a strong feeling, we won't have to worry about leftovers with this one.
