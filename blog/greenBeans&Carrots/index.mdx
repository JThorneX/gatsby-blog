You may have noticed by now, I'm not big on vegetables. If I could change this, I would - I would make myself love all the vegetables in the world, especially tomatoes cause those bitches be versatile as hell. But I don't. Most of them make me gag, unfortunately.

As mentioned in the [tex mex bowl](https://gatsbyblogmain59051.gatsbyjs.io/blog/tex-mex-bowl/), I tried HelloFresh a couple of years ago to broaden my horizons and really, geniunely tried to pick recipes that had some sort of vegetable side dish that I thought I would stomach. Only one of those side dishes stuck around, but that's one more (literally only just the one) vegetable dish I like that I didn't before so, y'know, progress!

- Air Fryer Temp: 400F
- Cooking Time: 15-20 minutes

<br />

1. Wash the carrots and green beans and put in a bowl. Drizzle olive oil over it, the amount shouldn't be too concerning, just make sure you coat everything enough, most of the oil will just stay behind in the bowl, and the rest more or less drips off in the air fryer.
2. Add garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Do some awkward tosses - you know where you try to mix it together but things keep falling out of the bowl but thoroughly coat everything.
3. Put into air fryer. Cook for 15 minutes at 400F. If you're making a truck ton, cook for 20 minutes.
