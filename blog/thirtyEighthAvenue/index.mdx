There's this really good Italian restaurant in North Denver in Highland called Gaetano's - they definitely do not have any affiliation with any...less than legal individuals anymore, nope not at all, they're model citizens and great people in general. Anyway, they make the best Fettucini Alfredo so get that but they also have this cocktail called the 38th Avenue that tastes like Christmas in a cup. A couple of years ago we got the deets on what exactly was in it and after researching it really quick literally just now, I now know it exists outside of this restaurant.

To the rest of the world, it started as a Rum drink called the three dots and a dash (V in morse code for victory) fittingly created at the end of WWII. Some dude in San Diego, a fan of the classic show Archer (excellent taste), took the ingredients in the ...- (see what I did there, I'm so clever) and swapped out rum for bourbon and called it the Lana Kane cocktail. I'll be honest, I have no idea if this is similar to the 38th Avenue, it's in the to try category, but the ingredients are all basically the same.
