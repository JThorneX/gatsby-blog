Never tell me what to do or you'll end up with a meat ring (threat). I was just trying to be a good child and make dinner for my parents one day, many years ago, so I asked my mother for a recipe for meatloaf and she had the _audacity_ to not only put "wash your hands" as a step but also "form the meat into the shape of a loaf" and I was simply affronted. In classic too-stubborn-for-my-own-good fashion, I refused to loaf my meat - don't worry, I washed my hands... I think - and instead made it in the shape of well, a wreath because it was the holidays, but ultimately a ring shape.

Well, I sure made everyone look like a fool when the meatloaf came out more amazing than any loafed meat we've ever had. My theory is it cooks more evenly and doesn't overcook parts so there's no random juicy bits mixed with painfully dry bits but I don't do culinary science so I have no idea. Regardless, this shit slaps, as the kids say.

I don't put mashed potatoes in the middle like the picture, but it looks neat, doesn't it?

- Oven Temp: 350F
- Cooking Time: 40-50 minutes
- Makes: A RING OF MEAT, probably like 24 slices? ish?

<br />

1. Mix together the meat, this really helps make the flavor of the finished meat more consistent.
2. Add all the other ingredients, mix well. Use your hands and be super grossed out.
3. Dust the bottom of the pan with breadcrumbs - helps with the meat sticking to the pan when it's done without having to use oil.
4. Take the meat and form it in the shape of A RING AND LAUGH ABOUT IT. Think you're so clever being a smart ass.
5. Cook for 40-50 minutes at 350F - check at 40min with thermometer if you're unsure like 99% of the population is.
6. Slice and don't you dare serve this with ketchup, I will hunt you down and knock your food out of your mouth and then yell at you until you cry.
7. Serve with [Babi Ranch](https://gatsbyblogmain59051.gatsbyjs.io/blog/babi-ranch-dressing/) and a side of smashed potatas.
